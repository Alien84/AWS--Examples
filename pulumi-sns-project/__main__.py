"""Amazon SNS: Implementing Pub/Sub Messaging with Pulumi"""
"""
Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) is a flexible, fully managed pub/sub messaging and mobile notification service 
for coordinating the delivery of messages to subscribing endpoints and clients. 
Using Pulumi to automate the setup and configuration of Amazon SNS topics can streamline communication workflows within your applications.

Using Pulumi to deploy Amazon SNS topics and subscriptions provides a robust and programmable way to manage messaging and notifications within your applications. 
This infrastructure-as-code approach helps maintain consistency, reduces deployment errors, and enhances the security of your pub/sub messaging setup.

"""

import pulumi
from pulumi_aws import sns

# Create an SNS topic
topic = sns.Topic('my-topic')

# Create an email subscription to the topic
email_subscription = sns.TopicSubscription('my-subscription',
    topic=topic.arn,
    protocol='email',
    endpoint='example@example.com')  # Replace with your email address

"""
Best Practices and Additional Configurations
Consider implementing best practices such as:
- Securing Topics: Use IAM policies to restrict who can publish and subscribe to the topic.
- Monitoring: Set up CloudWatch alarms for monitoring the number of messages published and delivered.
- Multiple Subscription Types: Besides email, consider adding subscriptions using other protocols like 
SMS, HTTP/S, or Lambda to handle different types of communication or integration needs.
