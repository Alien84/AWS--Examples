"""AWS CloudFormation: Managing Infrastructure as Code with Pulumi"""

import pulumi
from pulumi_aws import cloudformation

"""
This script sets up a basic CloudFormation stack that creates a private S3 bucket. 
You can replace the inline template with a path to a file containing a more complex CloudFormation template if needed.
"""

# Assume you have a CloudFormation template as a JSON or YAML file
# For this example, we'll define a simple template inline
cloudformation_template = """
Resources:
  MyBucket:
    Type: 'AWS::S3::Bucket'
    Properties:
      AccessControl: Private
"""

# Create a CloudFormation stack
stack = cloudformation.Stack('my-stack',
    template_body=cloudformation_template)

# Export the stack ID
pulumi.export('stack_id', stack.id)

"""
Best Practices and Additional Configurations
Consider implementing best practices such as:
- Template Validation: Before deploying, validate your CloudFormation templates to catch and fix any syntax or logical errors.
- Change Sets: Use CloudFormation change sets to preview how proposed changes to a stack might impact your running resources.
- Nested Stacks: For complex environments, use nested stacks to manage related resources in a more modular and maintainable way.
