"""AWS Elastic Beanstalk: Deploying Web Applications with Pulumi"""

"""
AWS Elastic Beanstalk is an easy-to-use service for deploying and 
scaling web applications and services developed with Java, .NET, PHP, Node.js, Python, Ruby, Go, 
and Docker on familiar servers such as Apache, Nginx, Passenger, and IIS.
"""

import pulumi
from pulumi_aws import elasticbeanstalk

# Create an Elastic Beanstalk application
app = elasticbeanstalk.Application('my-app',
    description='My Elastic Beanstalk Application')

# Define the solution stack
# You can find the latest solution stack names in the AWS Management Console
solution_stack_name = '64bit Amazon Linux 2 v3.3.12 running Python 3.8'

# Create an Elastic Beanstalk environment
env = elasticbeanstalk.Environment('my-env',
    application=app.name,
    solution_stack_name=solution_stack_name,
    settings=[
        {
            'namespace': 'aws:elasticbeanstalk:environment',
            'name': 'EnvironmentType',
            'value': 'SingleInstance'

Best Practices and Additional Configurations
Consider implementing best practices such as:
- Version Management: Manage application versions through Elastic Beanstalk and Pulumi to facilitate easy rollback and deployment of new versions.
- Environment Cloning: Use Pulumi to clone environments for staging and production to ensure consistency.
- Resource Monitoring: Utilize AWS CloudWatch integrated with Elastic Beanstalk for monitoring application health and performance.
